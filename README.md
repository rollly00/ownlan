# Ownlan

__Ownlan__ aims to be a simple, concise and useful pentesting LAN poisoning suite, Written in ``Ruby`` and using ``PacketFU`` for reading and sending the packets off the wire. I decided to make this suite of tools mainly due do to the lack of existing tools on Linux, on top of helping me understanding the whole process behind the scene. OwnLan got uniques features, with some exclusives and excitings attacks probably never ever used on a (pentesting) network.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ownlan'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ownaln

And require it in your application:

    irb(main):001:0> require 'ownlan'
    => true


## Usage

### Configuration ###
You can pass multiple variables that will be used in the gem.

```ruby
Ownlan.configure do |config|
      config.attack      = 'ntoa'
      config.victim_ip   = '192.168.0.1'
      config.delay       = 1.5
      config.random_mac  = true
      config.interface   = 'eth0'
end
```

You can also pass any of those options inline when loading an instance of Ownlan.

```ruby
ownlan = Ownlan.new(attack: 'ntoa', victim_ip: '192.168.0.1', delay: 1.5, random_mac: true)
```

## Launch Ownlan ##

### In your Ruby code ###

Once configured, you can run your instance of Ownlan with:

```ruby
ownlan.call
```

You are free to implement whatever way of your choice to handle concurrency: you can put this previous line in a `thread` for instance.

### Using the Command Line Interface  ###

```sh
  ownlan --attack client --target-ip 192.168.0.1 --interface eth0 --delay 0
```

Please look at the [cli section](#command-line-interface) for more advanced options.

## Features

**OwnLan** has three features:

1. Disconnect one or several users off the wire
2. Protecting users from those kind of attacks
3. Sending custom ARP + DHCP packets easily

### Disconnecting users off the wire

The biggest part of **OwnLan**. It disconnects clients thanks to severals techniques:

- Client side ARP Cache Poisoning (**first duplex**). *The most used and common attack nowadays, the main purpose is to make a MITM attack, but alone (= without IP forwarding), it will disconnect the client. Used by ``TuxCut`` and ``Arpspoof`` . If no MAC Adress is given, yours will be given.*

- Gateway side ARP Cache Poisoning (**second duplex**). *A less known attack and powerful one, used by ``NetCut`` , the principle is to give the gateway a fake correspondancy of the victim MAC Adress to make the later one unreachable. If no MAC Adress is given, yours will be given.*

- Neighbour Table Overflow attack. * The Neighbour Table Overflow attack will generate identifications packets to the specified target to completely isolate him from the network. The **NTOA** attack can be used to stress test client (gateway, computers) to see if they can undure heavy charges.

### Protecting clients

- Resynchronize . This feature will instanciate a full duplex ARP attack to resynchronize the client to the Gateway. Very useful against active attacks.


### Command Line Interface

You can also use the provided executable. Simple launch it in accordance to the following scheme:

    ownlan --[options] [sub-options] --[other-option]

- Where [options] are either:
Â 

        -a, --attack=<s>          Set an attack on a device on the network
                                  * Required: [sub-options]
        -p, --protect=<s>          Protect a device from lan attacks
                                  * Required: [sub-options]
        -b, --broadcast=<s>        Broadcast raw ARP packets to the wire.
                                  * Required Options : victim_ip, victim_mac, source_ip, source_mac

-  where [sub-options] are either:


        client              Set a First-Duplex disconnection attack (the client is targeted). If no source mac argument, yours will be given (useful for MITM Attacks).
                          * Required options: victim_ip
                          * Falcultative options: random_mac , source_mac
        gateway             Set a Second-Duplex disconnection attack (the gateway is targeted). If no source mac argument, yours will be given (useful for MITM Attacks).
                          * Required options: victim_ip
                          * Falcultative options: random_mac , source_mac
        ntoa                The client is targeted to get disconnected, using a neighbour table overflow attack. Requires a victim ip.
                          * Required options: victim_ip
                          * Falcultative options: random_mac
        resynchronize       Operate a dual duplex attack on a victim to disconnect the attacker and heal the victim. Warning: If you are the victim, you will have to fill the optional options.
                          * Required options: victim_ip
                          * Optional options: victim_mac , gateway_mac

- Where  [Other Options] can be:


        -d, --delay=<f>            Set the time lapse delay between each packet (default: 0.5)
        -i, --interface=<s>        Set the network interface which will be used (default: wlan0)
        -r, --random-source-mac    If setted, the used origin addresses will be randomly generated.
        -t, --victim-ip=<s>        Set the ip address of the target.
        -v, --victim-mac=<s>       Set the mac address of the target
        -g, --gateway-ip=<s>       Set the ip adress of the gateway
        -e, --gateway-mac=<s>      Set the mac adress of the gateway. (for Protect only)
        -s, --source-mac=<s>       Set the mac of the source mac address.
        -o, --source-ip=<s>        Set the ip address of the originating packet.
        -n, --version              Print version and exit
        -h, --help                 Show this message
